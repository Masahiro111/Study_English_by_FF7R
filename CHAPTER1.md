# CHAPTER 1

Barret:
Get down here, merc.

Security Officer:
Halt!

Security Officer:
Who goes there!?

Barret:
You're up.

Security Officer:
Who in the hell!?

Security Officer:
Hands where I can see 'em!

Jessie:
Have fun!

Security Officer:
Drop the weapon!

Biggs:
You got this!

Wedge:
Yeah, what he said!

Jessie:
So what's SOLDIER boy's deal?
Is he one of us now?
He's got balls, this, uh...
Uh...what was his name again?

Biggs:
Cloud. Cloud Strrife.

Jessie:
Right.

Biggs:
And he isn't a SOLDIER anymore.
Still, he's a professional --- unlike the rest of us.
I'm glad to have him.

Cloud:
This is a onetime gig.
When it's done, we're done.

Wedge:
C'mon, nobody'd do something this crazy just for money.
They may not think you're a true believer,
but you know what I think?

Cloud:
Not interested.

Barret:
You'd better be worth the money, merc.
Every last gil.

Biggs:
Not so fast. We've got company.

Barret:
SOLDIERs may attack on command,
but I hear they make good guard dogs too.
Bet you've seen a few reactors.
So how do we get to the bridge above mako storage?
Ain't holding out on me, are you?
Stamp scared to bite the hand that fed him?
Or is he a loyal little doggy!?
Have it your way, mutt. We can do this with you,
or we can do this without you.

Cloud:
Different reactor, different layout.
Depends when it was built.
Never seen one like this, but I'll manage.

Security Officer:
Who's there!?
Door!

Barret:
Wait!

Security Officer:
It's over!

Cloud:
That's my line.

Jessie:
It's a good thing I know someone who can get us the passcodes.
Pity no one else at command will talk to us,
but what can you do?
And we're good!

Biggs:
Careful in there.

Jessie:
So...you know Tifa, right?
It's not really my business, but are you guys close?

Tifa:
Cloud!
Are you ignoring me!?
